Simple tools I use to organize my movie collection

# Where does the data come from ?

A great thanks to [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and their amazing [API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/4/getting-started) ! They are responsible for every bit of metadata used by movie-tools.
